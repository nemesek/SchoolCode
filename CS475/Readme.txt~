Project for Spring 2012 Databases class
-I Realize I didn't follow best programming practices from PHP side of things e.g. Lack of auth, no includes, conn str info in plain text in unsecured dir.  Here is why I didn't worry about it:
- Never used PHP before and this was not a PHP project, the purpose of the web forms was a quick and dirty way to access the database, as the DB was what was being graded.  PHP files were not part of the reqs.

CSci 475 - Project
Spring 2012
General Description: The student will complete a self-conceived project that solves a nontrivial problem in computing science as approved by the instructor. The project must be approved by the instructor.
The project grade will account for 30% of the overall semester average.

Specific Project Requirements: This project must meet the following critera:

    Must include a document that details all analysis and design artifacts.
        Preliminary Design - Submit the following to your instructor for approval:
            A narrative of your proposal.
            A list of the entities with a description of the role of each one.
            A description of the relationships among the entities. (Your tables, keys, etc will emerge from these.)
            A list of the scenarios in which your database will be used. (the queries and user interfaces will emerge from these.) 
        Final Design - Once the preliminary proposal is approved, complete and submit the following:
            An Entity-Relationship Diagram.
            Definition of the tables in 4NF. (Include a listing of each table in the progression from un-normalized to 4NF as appropriate.)
            A list of the SQL Queries that will be required to support your scenarios. 
    Must provide Web-based Forms that allow the user to View, Insert, Modify and Delete data from the database in support of the required scenarios. 

Note: This project is student selected (and approved by instructor), and is not associated with a sponsor. While you can get your idea for your project from your past or current job, the actual project needs to be independent of any specifics for that business.

Scope: The scope of this project should be comparable to the Premiere Products Example from the text.
