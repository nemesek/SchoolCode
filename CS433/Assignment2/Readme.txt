Program #2:   Ancestry
Due: Wednesday, April 18, 2012 at Midnight

Program Description
For this program, you will investigate operations on a tree of ancestry information.
Input Format
The data contains information about individuals, one per line. Each line contains the following six items, tab delimited:

    A unique ID
    Name
    ID of father, or -1 if not known
    ID of mother, or -1 if not known
    Birth year if known, -1 otherwise
    Death year if known, -1 otherwise

A sample data file of the Kennedy clan is available. The data set was adapted from http://www.genealogy.com/famousfolks/kennedy/index.htm. A graphic of the data set is available there. You can use any data structure you like. Your program should read the data file and create internal data structures as needed then prompt the user with the following options. In each case, display information neatly and given clear error messages as appropriate.

    Given an ID, display information about that individual.
    Given an ID, display information about the parents of that individual.
    Given an ID, return a count of the number of known ancestors of the individual.
    Given an ID, list the ancestors of the individual, indicating how many generations back each individual is from the initial person. For example, parents are +1, grandparents are +2, and so on.
    Given an ID, list the immediate children of the individual.
    Given and ID, return a count of the number of known descendants of that individual.
    Given an ID, list the descendants of the individual, indicating how many generations forward each individual is from the initial person. For example, children are +1, grandchildren are +2, and so on. 

Graduate vs. Undergraduate
Graduate students should include an option to identify the "least common ancestors" of two individuals. That is, given two IDs of siblings, the LCAs are the parents. Cousins would have LCAs of the grandparents. If there is no LCA for the two individuals, give an informative message.

Programs may to be written in Java or C/C++ (so long as it compiles on the department server Turing or in the Adler lab). Please do not use any Windows specific code.

You may use code from books or websites, but be sure to cite the source in the documentation (comments) of your program. Be sure to include all code necessary to recompile your program.

Follow the programming guidelines!

Email a SINGLE archive file (zip, tar, etc) containing all code necessary to compile and run your program to dwilkins@cs.olemiss.edu. Minimally, you will need to include your graph classes and the driver program, and the output generated by your program on the sample file provided.
