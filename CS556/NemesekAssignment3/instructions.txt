1) Compile star.ex and master_slave.ex with elixirc or run build.sh
2) iex test_driver.exs
3) From within iex (these will execute a few automated tests with various ranges and values):
  - Tester.runStarTest
  - Tester.runMSTest

To test yourself
From iex:
  - Star.run(n,m) -- where n = processes and m = number of messages to each process
  - MS.start(N) -- where N = Number of slave processes
    -- MS.to_slave(msg, N) -- if msg == "die" or :die the slave should exit
