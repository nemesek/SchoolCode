CSCI 211 -- Computer Science III
Spring 2012
Project 4

Due Date: Wednesday 4/25.

Lab Objective: This lab is designed to give the student practice in the implementation of a Java program that demonstrates skill in the implementation of a the Heap Interface at http://www.cs.olemiss.edu/~cbzickos/cs211/heap.html.

Problem Description:

Part I: Write a class named ArrayHeap that implements the Heap Interface. You can use your work from Closed Lab 9 as a starting point but use the new copy of Heap.java from this link vs. the one used for the Closed lab. Your implementation must support both minimum and maximum heaps by use of a Comparator which is passed to the ArrayHeap constructor.

Part II: Write a client program named HeapDemo that will demonstrate that each method works correctly.

Program Instructions:

Requirements:

    (90 pts.) Complete Parts I and II using correct algorithms, appropriate data structures and object oriented design.
    (10 pts.) Follow all programming standards and conventions listed at http://home.olemiss.edu/~cbzickos/cs111/prgStanConv.html including Heading line comment must be in every module.
    (5 pts.) Provide a written copy of the Testing Plan and Test Results 

Instructions for Submitting Your Program for Grading:

    On or before the due date, e-mail your source code in .zip-file format as an attached file(s) to cbzickos@olemiss.edu. Use your own e-mail account. In the event that you cannot use your own account, then include your name on the subject line.
    Use the Subject Line: CS211 Project 4.
