Test Plan
1) Tested try catch block to ensure that in case an input file was not found, the application would still run and all default entries would be set to zero.
2) Tested with non numeric data.  If a user enters something non numeric then the bad text field entry will be replaced with a zero. For example the input list a,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9 will not validate and the first entry will be changed from a to zero.
3) Tested to ensure that no integers less than 1 are valid entries.  If user enters in non-positive integer entry and hit Calculate they will recieve a message indicating all input data must be positive integers.  For example the following lists will fail 1,2,3,4,0,6,7,8,9 and 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,-9
3) Tested to ensure that all input integers were distinct.  For example the entry 1,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8 will display a message to user that all integers must be unique
4) Tested 2,7,6,9,5,1,4,3,8 to ensure that it successfully validated the Magic Square. 
5) Tested 8,1,6,3,5,7,4,9,2 to ensure that it successfully validated the Magic Square.
6) Tested lists with valid input data but incorrect sums to ensure that summing formulas didn't allow false positives.  For example the list 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9 will fail.
